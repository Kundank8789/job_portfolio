# Kundan Kumar — Developer Portfolio (Clean)

This is a developer-focused portfolio (Option C) prepared as a ready-to-edit Next.js project.

## What I added
- Resume: `public/assets/resume/Kundan_Kumar_resume.pdf`
- Navbar + Hero with Download Resume buttons
- About, Skills, Certifications, Projects (placeholders)
- Tailwind setup files (postcss, tailwind.config)

## How to run (on your machine)
1. `cd` into the project folder (where package.json is)
2. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3. `npm run dev`

## How to add your project URLs
Edit `data/projects.js` and add `github` and `live` links.
